# User Interface

- Styling could be better. Less of the individual company color. The Nav is fine, but the big blocky headers could look a lot better. Maybe lean towards a more neutral design with specific strategic elements using the branding colors to add the right amount of color.

- I think it could be more minimalist, and less boring business.

- Logo in top left is noticeably lower res than when nav is open

- Chase/Citi Logo Stretched on Nav Open

- Calendar Event color green on Chase. I'm assuming this color is auto generated because you can have multiple "branch" calendars. Possibly the intended behavior.

- "Noble One" title and favicon in browser tab even though Chase or Citi are the active tenant.

- Prev and Next buttons on calendar can be swapped out for arrows for cleaner look.

- Not a big fan of the rounded tabs, are ugly.

- "Tenancy" is misspelled in Nav.
