# User Interface

- Styling could be better. Less of the individual company color. The Nav is fine, but the big blocky headers could look a lot better. Maybe lean towards a more neutral design, with specific strategic elements using the branding colors to add the right amount of color.

- I think it could be more minimalist, and less "business"

- Logo in top left is noticeably lower res than when nav is open

- Chase Logo Stretched on Nav Open

- Calendar Event color green on Chase. I'm assuming this color is auto generated because you can have multiple "branch" calendars. Intended?


- "Noble One" title and favicon in browser tab even though I'm in Chase or Citi dashboard

- Prev and Next buttons on calendar can be swapped out for arrows for cleaner look.

- Not a big fan of the rounded tabs

- "Tenancy" is misspelled in Nav. 


- Cannot log in on safari (Dont know why)

- All button on bashboard: What does it do? Why does it stay highlighted when clicked?

- Reporting: Saved Queries automatically uploads .csv even though after clicking it says to select what you want to put in the file

- Tentancy's 9 box button (by trash can) directs you to login page

- Recently view in the munu is cut off until the user has viewed something

- Reporting exort button not working
