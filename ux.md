# User Experience

- On login user is routed to "Tenancy"  page rather than a dashboard. This is the last Nav item in the menu, and the title of that page is Tennant Management Dashboard. There is a separate Nav item for "Dashboard". I think this would be confusing for a user.

- Tasks are a little confusing. You can add tasks in various other menus, but there is also a dedicated menu for tasks.

- Reporting Page, I would assume, is extremely critical, and right now it's very clunky.

- No "X" icon to close window on "Manage Account"

- Ability to find a person or company outside of chat?

- Multiple Chats at same time?

- Some nav items like Calendar add user interactions in the component. Where others like tasks add user interactions to top Nav.

- Maybe top Plus icon should have multiple drop down options? Add Prospect, Add Company, Add Task, Add Calendar Event, etc...

- Same for Search? Search task, person, business, etc...

- Mobile Responsiveness isn't there

- Some nav pages use vertical functionality like "Reporting" where the queries are saved on the left side of the component. Others like User Setting are horizontal- along the top of the component. This feels disjointed from a UX perspective.

- Reporting too clustered, select fields take up too much space 

- Dashboard: the top and bottom footers are too much to look at when its such a same list

- Seems too condense. Small areas with scroll bars, if theres too many profiles scroll bar will be too long

- Notifications oddly to the left

- Settings tabs not all same length

- Personly dont like the fact that clicking on a business takes the user to another page

- Reporting exort button not working
