# User Experience

- Maybe create a "Tutorial" that shows a new user how the app functions.

- On login user is routed to "Tenancy"  page rather than a dashboard. This is the last Nav item in the menu, and the title of that page is Tennant Management Dashboard. There is a separate Nav item for "Dashboard". I think this would be confusing for a user. This is specific to logging into the Noble dashboard. Chase and Citi route a logged in user to the "Dashboard". Possibly intended behavior.

- Tasks are a little confusing. You can add tasks in various other menus, but there is also a dedicated menu for tasks.

- Reporting Page, I would assume, is extremely critical, and right now it's very clunky. A lot of scroll bars within scroll bars.

- No "X" icon to close window on "Manage Account".

- Ability to find a person or company outside of chat?

- Multiple Chats at same time?

- Some nav items like Calendar add user interactions in the component. Where others like tasks add user interactions to top Nav.

- Maybe top Plus icon should have multiple drop down options? Add Prospect, Add Company, Add Task, Add Calendar Event, etc...

- Same for Search? Search task, person, business, etc...

- Mobile Responsiveness isn't there.

- Some nav pages use vertical functionality like "Reporting" where the queries are saved on the left side of the component. Others like User Setting are horizontal- along the top of the component. This feels disjointed from a UX perspective.

- When hovering over a link, it is kind of hard to see if there is any hover effect at all .

- I believe that `Recently Viewed` and `No Recent Items` should both be either centered or aligned to the left.

- The buttons that are active or selected in the `Calendar` tab look a bit off / doesn't fit well with the color scheme.
